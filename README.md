# API Documentation

When starting the server with no db files, the products database will autofill. The database for customers will insert a guest user thats logged in by default.

The guest user is limited to some operations to limit potential bugs. The Guest cannot log itself out, update or delete itself.

You can create a new customer and login on that account to access more API requests.
